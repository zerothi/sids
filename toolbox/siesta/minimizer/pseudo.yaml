# Define a level for each atom
# Atoms are defined by "tag" so one can customize by changing
# the tag/label for the specie
# Only requirement is that the tag may not have a dot (.) in them.

# All defaults are prefixed with def_* to clarify they
# don't belong to any atom set in particular.


# Create defaults
# These are definitions that should only be referenced
# through the identifiers

  # Definition of the radius of the core-correction
  # If zero, then not used
  initial: 1.8
  bounds: [0.5, 2.4]

def_core_correction: &def_core_correction
  # Definition of the radius of the core-correction
  # This is very ill-adviced to use since it changes
  # total energy (immensely) for different values.
  # It is better to fix this, then do a subsequent minimization
  # and repeat.
